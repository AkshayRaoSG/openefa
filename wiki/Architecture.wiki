#summary Summary of EFA's architecture

= Introduction =

EFA consists of a number of XML generators and XSLT transforms.

The URLs are of the form:
http://site.tld/frontend/VERB?param=value&param=value

== Verbs ==

For every REQUEST verb, there are two basic forms: XML_VERB and XSLT_VERB.  The verb is probably a Java servlet, which uses passed back parameters to change session state.

= Frontends =

Frontends are probably just a different set of XSLTs.  For example, the TFL has /bcl/ to generate high-visibility pages and /lite/ to provide JSON output.
