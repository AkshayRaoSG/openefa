#summary Summary of EFA's architecture

= Introduction =

EFA consists of a number of XML generators and XSLT transforms.

The URLs are of the form:
http://site.tld/frontend/SERVICE?param=value&param=value

== [Services] ==

For every REQUEST service, there are two basic forms: XML_SERVICE_REQUEST and XSLT_SERVICE_REQUEST.  Each service is probably a Java servlet, which uses passed back parameters to change session state.  There is also XSDM_SERVICE_REQUEST, but this doesn't appear to be used properly yet.

= Frontends =

Frontends are probably just a different set of XSLTs.  For example, the TFL has /bcl/ to generate high-visibility pages and /lite/ to provide JSON output.
